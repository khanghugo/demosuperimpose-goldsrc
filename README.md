# demosuperimpose-goldsrc

Demo superimpose/ghost reimplementation of [demsuperimpose](https://github.com/matthewearl/demsuperimpose) and [demogobbler](https://github.com/lipsanen/demogobbler) for GoldSrc.

~~Beside that functionality, this thing can also write and parse demo~~.It will be moving to a different repository [dem](https://github.com/khanghugo/dem)

demosuperimpose-goldsrc will be purely for implementation of demo tools.

## Why

I am not sure. Beside the obvious uplift of compiled executable, [coldemoplayer](https://github.com/jpcy/coldemoplayer) pretty much has already finished all the hard work beside a writer. Bandwagon I think.

## How

Check for files in `src/demo_doer/` to see how to write your own functionality.

## Acknowledgement

Mostly based of these.
